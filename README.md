# React Router POC
This is a Proof of Concept (POC) project showcasing the implementation of React Router in a small React application. The project includes a navigation bar for easy navigation between different pages within the application.

## Features
- **React Router**: Utilizes React Router for declarative routing in the application.
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes a navigation bar component for seamless navigation between pages.
- **Multiple Pages**: Demonstrates routing between multiple pages within the application.

## Usage

To run the project locally, execute the following command:

```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. You can then interact with the navigation bar to switch between different pages.

## Dependencies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/): Declarative routing for React applications.
